### Sound characteristics

#### 1.  Amplitude: 
Amount of pertubation in the air pressure.

#### 2. Frequency: 
- Number of data points per second, similar to sampling rate! 
- Frequencies are logarithmic as in 2 frequencies are percieved differently if they differ by a power of 2.

#### 3. Pitch: 
the degree of highness or lowness of a tone. 

- A4 to A5 is jump from 440Hz to 880Hz (changing octaves)
- higher frequency -> higher sound
- larger amplitude -> louder sound

#### 4. Sound power:
Energy per unit per time <br>
Intensity is per unit area <br>
Every 3 dBs, intensity doubles

#### 5. Loudness
- subjective unlike intensity
- depends on duration/frequency of sound
- depends on age

#### 5. Timbre
- kind of like color of sound
- difference between two sounds of same intensity, frequency, duration
- descrption: bright, dull, harsh, etc.

### Sound characteristics

#### Analog to digital conversion
- sampling
- quantization

Dynamic range: higher the resolution, higher the DR
